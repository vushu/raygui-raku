## raygui-raku (Raygui::Bindings)

Autogenerated raygui-raku bindings, powered by raku grammar and
actions.
### Preface
To make Raku play together with Raygui, many of Raygui's functions has to be wrapped into a function,
to support pass as pointer meaning we are `"pointerizing"` the functions. This is done automatically when generating the bindings.
The bindings are also converted to `kebab-case` to fit Raku code style.

#### On installation: 
- `raygui.h` will be downloaded from https://github.com/raysan5/raygui/blob/master/src/raygui.h and build
- `Bindings.rakumod` will be generated and placed into lib/Raygui 
- The pointerization and allocation C code gets compiled to be used by Raygui::Bindings.

Raygui::Bindings comes with support for malloc-ing Raygui structs,
